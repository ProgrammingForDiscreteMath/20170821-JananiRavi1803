1. Please do not put your solutions in a separate file. I may not be able to locate it. Instead please modify ``code.py``.

2. You module docstring (lines 1 and 2) is incorrectly indented. There should be no indents.

3. The function ``is_prime`` is very inefficient. There is no need to store all the remainders. All you need to do is go through the integers up to square root of ``n``. The moment you find that a remainder is 0, you can return ``False``. Score 2/5.

**Total score: 12/15**
